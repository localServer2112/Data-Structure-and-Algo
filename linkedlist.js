// what is a linked list?
// it consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null -- it contains a head, tail and length property

/** linked list vs array
 * 
 * linked list -- Do not have indices, connected via nodes with a next pointer, random access is not allowed
 * 
 * arrays -- indexed in order, insertion and deletion can be expensive, can be quickly accessed at a specific index
 *
